# BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

In the current world, the film industry is so dynamic and it captivates audiences worldwide. Understanding the performance of movies across various categories provides valuable insights into:

Trends
Audience preference
Factors Contributing to the success of a film
With the required information by Microsoft, they will be able to achieve success in the industry as they will be able to familiarize themselves with factors that influence movie's market space performance.

The analysis will further examine the dataset's composition, specifically numerical and categorical variables, using graphical methods.

# BUSINESS PROBLEM

Microsoft is interested in getting into the movie industry but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. In this project, i will focus on analyzing which types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translate my findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

# CORRELATION IN DATA

Below are two images showing how my data correlates.

# CONCLUSION

From the data and the graphs visuals it is noted that the charts go up in May and November for both movie popularity and vote count against release month. For Microsoft to lead in the industry in terms of success, it should focus on the recommendations below.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
The above visualizations have made it clear that Microsoft should focus on the following:

The language used in a movie
The more common the language the higher the audience reaches and as a result increased return on investment(ROI). In the above analysis, the common language is denoted by 'en' which I suppose is English. It will be best that Microsoft should focus more on this as compared to (gu, xx, and hu) for its success. For example, it is seen in movies such as Infinity War, John Wick, the Avengers, and The Battle of the Five Armies which are popular and they all have similarities in the language that they use which is English. With this, we get to know that for the success of a movie, language is a critical factor to think of.

The type of movie genre
Microsoft should focus on the use of multiple genres in the movie industry as this is important in matters such as audience diversification, cultural representation, and also increased financial stability. In the above analysis, it's seen that multiple_genres have the highest vote count. For example, some of the popular movies like John Wick, Infinity War, and The Avengers fall under multiple types of genres.

Production budget
Here, for Microsoft to thrive well in the movie industry, they have to focus on things such as market research, new technology, and script quality. for example the higher the script quality the higher the chances of movie success regardless of the budget size which in turn will increase the total amount of money a movie generates from ticket sales worldwide(world gross). For example, even though Avengers is more popular compared to Avatar Microsoft should know that script quality should be prioritized more compared to the production budget.

This is because Avatar has a higher production budget compared to Avengers but still when it comes to popularity, Avengers leads.

Vote count
This is several votes a certain film receives in terms of awards and nominations. In the above analysis, it is noted that multiple_genres movies have the highest count for example as is seen in 'Inception'. Since it is said in business that a customer is always right, Microsoft should focus on what the market needs and quench its thirst by focusing on movie production in line with the customers' interests.

# FUTURE WORK

As a data analyst, this is what I would like to work on in the future:

1. Predictive modeling for box office success.
2. Audience sentiments and behavior analysis in social platforms and how they affect movie performance.
3. Impact of streaming platforms on traditional box office and its impact on revenue distribution and long-term profitability
